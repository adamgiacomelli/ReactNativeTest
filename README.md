# Issues
- ~~Images are currently added by pasting an url in the form~~ Images are now selected from gallery or directly from camera
- Form validation is ~~almost non-existent~~ ready for anything :)
- ~~Styling is very basic -> a more complete styling solution should be implemented~~ Styling is now more complete and styling code was moved out of inline styles
